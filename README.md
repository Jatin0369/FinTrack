# FinTrack
## Financial Tracking System project created using python, tkinter GUI library and MySQL.

This project was created by me for learing purpose.I learnt about python and its GUI library tkinter. When initially the project was 
created in tkinter, it look quite boring and its UI was outdated by years it felt like windows XP era like UI. Then i learnt more about
tkinter and the resources availabe on web about it.Tkinter does not has web resources like HTML, CSS but still got to know about 
*ttkbootstrap* https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ that provides a lot of widgets and pre-built themes to work with.
But it was *custom tkinter* https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/ that gave the ultimate options for customisation.
With it i was able to do a lot of stuff that was otherwise not possible.
